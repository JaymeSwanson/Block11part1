        <h3>Project 1: Created a Website for Professional Pet Photography</h3>
        <section>As pets are becoming more popular to own, especially in the younger generation, I found a niche in
            photography to begin a professional pet photography business. This website contains numberous pictures of
            various pets, as well as logos, links, and contact information. This site has begun generating revenue for
            the company and is the only pet profesional photography business in the local area of east Florida.
