<h2>Recent Projects That I Have Accomplished</h2>
<section>
    <h3>Project 1: Created a Website for Professional Pet Photography</h3>
    <section>As pets are becoming more popular to own, especially in the younger generation, I found a niche in
        photography to begin a professional pet photography business. This website contains numberous pictures of
        various pets, as well as logos, links, and contact information. This site has begun generating revenue for
        the company and is the only pet profesional photography business in the local area of east Florida.
